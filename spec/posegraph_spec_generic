Title: ASL Pose Graph Specification

Abstract
========

This spec standardizes a pose graph API to provide interaction with vision 
inertial and laser based SLAM data. The goal is to define which types
of interaction are planned with the algorithm and how the datastructures
should be defined in order to be generic but not over-engineered.


Motivation
==========

It showed that many groups in ASL are interested in a generic pose graph 
implementation which would allow the transparent integration of localization
information to a pose graph. This should be independent of the algorithms 
running on the robot so that portability and multi-robot use is given.
