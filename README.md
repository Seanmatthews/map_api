Visual Inertial Localization

===========================
= Workflow for the moment =
===========================
Temporary workflow to speed up development and reviews.

master <-- develop <--- branch_developer_1
                 ^----- branch_developer_2
                 
Do NOT push to master and develop directly, use pull request instead. 

Pull-requests from develop to master should be reviewed publicly. (all)
Pull-requests from feature_branches to develop should be reviewed by the contributing developers. (Thomas, Matthias,..)
