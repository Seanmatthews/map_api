\section{Overview}

The Map API is to provide a mean for robots to collaborate on maps on a large
scale, in a distributed (peer to peer) manner. The reference mapping algorithm
is (collaborative) keyframe bundle adjustment, but the design should allow the 
use of any algorithm down the road.

In order to achieve such generality, the data that is shared among the robots is
structured into tables that can be specified by the algorithms.

In other words, thus, the goal is to develop an application-specific peer to
peer database system.

\subsection{Keyframe bundle adjustment}

To illustrate use cases in this document, we will use a hypothetical application
performing collaborative keyframe bundle adjustment. 

The main data unit of the algorithm is what we call a mission. A mission
represents a single robot's trajectory in the world, along with its perception
during that trajectory.

The first thing that is known about a mission is the raw sensor data. We assume
that the robots participating in the application dispose of at least a camera
and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Without going into too much detail, the
algotithm then generates a first 3D estimation of the trajectory and of salient
features in the environment (landmarks). The trajectory is represented by a
graph where each vertex represents a reasonably sampled pose (keyframe) of the
robot during its trajectory, and each edge a spatial transformation between two 
keyframes. Such a graph is also called "pose graph".

Once a first estimate is given, the pose graph and landmark position estimations
and other estimated parameters can then be further optimized using an algorithm
called Bundle Adjustment. In particular, it is interesting to jointly optimize
several missions - this is where the collaboration between robots happens.

\subsection{Implementation}

The Map API is implemented as a C++ library, relying on Google Protocol buffers
for serializable structures and ZeroMQ for networking purposes.

\section{Data structure}

To ensure flexibility, data is stored in tables that can be specified by
applications. The table schemata are stored in a particular table (metatable) 
that is hardcoded in the library and shared accross all peers. Rows in a table
are referred to as "items".

\subsection{Indexing}

Each item is assigned an identifier/key that is supposed to be unique per table.
To enable lock-free insertion, the identifier is a randomly generated 128 bit 
byte string, and for the scope of this project the assumption is made that no
conflicts will ever happen.

We are aware that Distributed Hash Tables take the approach of choosing the key
as a hash of the item data. However, we are not sure how that would relate to
updates in the data, an operation that we would like to support.

\subsection{Create-read VS Create-read-update tables}

To make use of performance advantages that can be achieved when no update
operation needs to be supported, the distinction is made between these two
kinds of tables. Create-read-update tables keep their history. In particular,
all revisions are stored in the same table, identifiable by a "update\_time" 
field. The revisions furthermore keep references to previous and next revision.
The first revision of an item has a nil previous reference while the latest
revision has a nil next reference. \todo{tcies: diagram}

As the naming suggests, delete operations are not explicitly supported. Instead,
we hope to enforce network mechanisms that remove irrelevant data, as for
instance described in 3.4 of \cite{freenet}.

\section{Problems to solve}

\begin{enumerate}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \label{itm:robust} How can data be stored in a way that is robust to 
    loss of connectivity to peers?
  \item \label{itm:lookup} How can data be looked up in an efficient way?
  \item \label{itm:update} How can data be updated?
\end{enumerate}

We understand that both \ref{itm:robust} and \ref{itm:lookup} are very common
problems in peer-to-peer networks and have been solved in multiple ways in
e.g. different implementations of Dynamic Hash Tables.

As for \ref{itm:update}, we believe it becomes a bit trickier. Bitcoin, for
instance, solves this problem, but we are not sure whether we want to adapt
their solution. We see the following differences to Bitcoin:

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Bitcoin offers incentives for mining
  \item Unless someone attempts a double-spending attack or initiates
    transactions from two different clients, there should be no conflicts in
    transactions, as each agent operates on their own account. A more often 
    occuring conflict is blockchain forks (we have read your paper), and we
    might use the Bitcoin solution for conflict resolution in the Map API.
  \item In Bitcoin, each agent knows about the full state of the transaction
    history. This is not required for the Map API
\end{itemize}

\section{Suggested solution}

\subsection{Chunks}

To help addressing \ref{itm:robust} and \ref{itm:lookup}, we would like to
group items in a table in so-called "chunks". These are to be the smallest units
of what is shared, i.e. if a client needs some data in chunk A, it must fetch
the entire chunk. The association of data to a chunk
is at the discretion of the node inserting the data. It is expected that:

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Data sharing the same chunk is related in some way: A client that
    performs an application-typical use case should not need to fetch more than
    a handful of chunks.
  \item Chunk size does not exceed what can be shared reasonably fast, say
    100MB tops
\end{itemize}

Then, a client desiring access to the latest version of some data in some chunk
must agree to the following contract to the best of its knowledge:

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item It must keep track of all other peers sharing the same chunk (swarm)
  \item It must maintain the latest version of the data contained in the chunk
  \item It must make sure that all changes to the chunk data are propagated to
    the peers sharing the data.
  \item If a new peer wants to join the chunk, it must provide that peer with
    the necessary information for it to be able to comply with the contract
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Distributed locks in chunks}

Instead of trying to come up with lock-free solutions, we admit the use of
locks in order to synchronize diverse operations that need it. Because full
connectivity is assumed among peers sharing a chunk, a peer can just ask all
other peers to grant the lock. Conflicts can be resolved by majority. What peer
votes for what peer to hold the lock creates a partition of the chunk network.
A peer contending for a lock can then relinquish the lock if the partition 
voting for it is not the largest one. In case of ties, a common arbitrary rule
can be applied, such as that the peer with the smaller IP address obtains the
lock.

The lock is only considered aquired once all peers have confirmed the same lock
holder.

All locks are timed to ensure robustness in case that the lock holder leaves
the network while holding the lock. A synchronized clock is used among the
Map API clients.

\subsubsection{Joining a chunk}

In order to join a chunk, a client must at least know the address of one of the
chunk participants. That peer, the "adder", locks the chunk such that the chunk
data is not modified during the process of adding the new peer. This ensures
conistency of the chunk state at the new peer, which could for instance be
violated if some peer adds data to the chunk while the adder transmits its state
to the new peer.

Once the lock is acquired, the adder sends the address of the new peer to the
chunk swarm, the addresses in the swarm to the new peer, and the chunk data to
the new peer. As the lock is released, it is as if the new peer had always been
in the swarm.

Locally in the clients, the lock is a reader/writer lock: It is write-locked
for peer addition and real-locked for all other operations.

\subsubsection{Leaving a chunk and robustness to peer loss}

Unlike with joining, leaving a chunk does not require maintaining a consistent
state at the affected peer, and locking is not required. It may anyways be that
a peer loses connection without intention. There are two ways a peer can leave
the swarm: With or without notification.

When the peer leaves with notification, it informs the swarm about leaving, and
the peers in the swarm can simply remove the peer from their peer list.

When the peer leaves without notification, the first peer that tries to connect
with it notifies the swarm about the missing peer.

Thus, even if the notification of a peer leaving does not reach all peers in the
swarm, for instance if a new peer is being added to the swarm, the behavior
is robust because in the worst case the peer that did not get notified
broadcasts a redundant notification.

Peers in the swarm have the ability to send out chunk participation requests
to table peers (see below), even if the latter don't require access to chunk
data. This gives content creators the ability to ensure that their newly created
persists in the network even if nobody requests their data before they leave the
network. 

For now, accpetation of participation requests relies on good will, i.e. it is 
not incentivized. It is at this point that irrelevant data gets removed from the
network over time: Peers may decide to impose a limit on chunks held on good
will, and periodically discard least recently accessed chunks, by monitoring
chunk activity.

\subsubsection{Data insertion}

To insert data into a chunk, the peer addition lock must be read-locked, only 
locally. Once that is the case, the inserted data is simply shared with the 
swarm.

\subsubsection{Updates}

To update data, first the local peer addition lock must be read-locked, then a 
distributed update lock must be acquired.

\subsection{Table}

Each client holds a peer list for each table that it participates in. Unlike
chunk swarms, table swarms don't need to be fully connected. However, like in
Bitcoin, each client should hold a minimum of connections. These connections
serve the purpose of looking up data that is not in a held chunk (which leads
to participation in the chunk of that data) and of sending participation
requests. 

Similarly, each client holds a peer list for the entire Map API, and the
operation for finding tables are equivalent to the operations for finding
chunks in the table.

\subsubsection{Naive index lookup}

If a client knows the ID of the table item it is looking for, e.g. by receiving
a reference from somewhere else, it sends out a request to the table swarm. Each
peer that receives such a request then looks for the data in its instance of the
table and either responds with chunk identifier and its own address (so that the
requester may send a chunk join request) or forwards the request to its peers in
rumor spreading fashion \cite{bitcoin}. This unfortunately eventually troubles
the entire table swarm with the request, but the requester does not wait for the
request to traverse the entire swarm, but only for the first positive response. 

\subsubsection{Binary-tree (quadtree, octree) range lookup}

The ID of the item that is looked for is not always know a priori.
